# 📊 Product Requirements Document (PRD): PacketPulse-Sniffer
- **Project:** PacketPulse-Sniffer
- **Author:** Expert Business Analyst
- **Status:** APPROVED & FINAL
- **Version:** 1.0.0

## 1. Executive Summary
Deep packet inspection and protocol metric aggregator extracting DNS query latency, TCP handshake delays, and HTTP header anomalies with live streaming.

## 2. User Personas & Scenarios
- **DevOps / SRE Engineer:** Needs reliable, low-overhead tooling with clear health check endpoints and Prometheus telemetry.
- **Software Architect:** Demands zero runtime bloat, deterministic data structures, and transparent error handling.
- **Frontend / Full-Stack Developer:** Needs an intuitive, dark-mode real-time web UI to observe engine status.

## 3. Behavioral Specifications (Given-When-Then BDD)
```gherkin
Feature: Core Engine Processing and Telemetry
  Scenario: Client requests operational health status
    Given the engine is running on port 6020
    When a GET request is dispatched to /api/health
    Then the response status code must be 200 OK
    And the response payload must contain status: "UP"

  Scenario: Client executes domain computation
    Given a valid computational payload
    When a POST request is sent to /api/process with Content-Type: application/json
    Then the engine must process the payload in sub-millisecond time
    And return success: true with processed metadata
```
